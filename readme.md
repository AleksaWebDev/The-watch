## The watch

The Golden watch is my idea from design to implementation. The watch can be opened by clicking on the lid and closed by clicking on the button that appears when the watch opens. For the lid rotation was used 3D transformation. The watch shows the time with the three hands, and also displays the current date. There is a function to turn on the sound. The watch is drawn with only html and css, responsive.
